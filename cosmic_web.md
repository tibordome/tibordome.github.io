On scales of $$1-100$$ Mpc the matter distribution of the Universe forms a weblike pattern of voids separated by walls, 
filaments and nodes - the *cosmic web* [Bond et al. 1996](https://www.nature.com/articles/380603a0). The most prominent 
features of the cosmic web are filaments, and beyond the well-known Pisces-Perseus chain 
[Giovanelli & Haynes 1985](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...292..404G/abstract) in the local Universe, entire filament 
inventories have been catalogued [Tempel et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.438.3465T/abstract). The largest 
filaments act as highways of the Universe, channelling dark matter, gas and galaxies into the higher density node 
regions. The nodes contain the highest density of galaxy clusters and superclusters such as the Great Attractor [Lynden-Bell
et al. 1988](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988ApJ...326...19L/abstract), the Shapley concentration 
[Ragone et al. 2006](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...445..819R/abstract) or the Vela 
supercluster [Kraan-Korteweg et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466L..29K).

The 2D components of the cosmic web, sheet-like membranes, are more difficult to detect in the spatial mass distribution 
traced by galaxies due to their lower surface density. The spatial structure outlined by galaxy clusters, however, does feature flattened 
supercluster configurations coined great walls, the most outstanding of which are the CfA Great Wall 
[Geller & Huchra 1989](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989Sci...246..897G/abstract), the 
Sloan Great Wall [Gott et al. 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...624..463G/abstract), the BOSS Great Wall 
[Lietzen et al. 2016](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/04/aa28261-16/aa28261-16.html) and the supergalactic plane 
[Lahav et al. 2000](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/312/1/166/984983). Finally, large void regions are prominent features 
in redshift surveys as they are practically devoid of any galaxy. Recent studies (Sutter et al. 2012; Leclercq et al. 2015) provide 
increasingly refined maps and catalogues of the void population in the local Universe. Out of all known voids, the Local 
Void with a diameter of 30 Mpc is closest to the Milky Way.

At high redshift, the Universe evolves mostly linearly, i.e. linear relativistic (or Newtonian) perturbation theory (PT) still provides an accurate 
description of gravitational collapse in an expanding Universe. When applying linear PT to a Gaussian field, which provides an accurate description of 
primordial density fluctuations in the early Universe, one finds that different wavelength modes do not couple; they evolve independently. 
The cosmic web is still in the linear or quasi-linear phase of collapse. Since FDM on large scales (including halo scales) is most manifest in an 
effective small-scale cutoff of the primordial density fluctuations, i.e. affecting small-scale modes, FDM imprints on the cosmic web 
at high-$$z$$ are especially pronounced. These imprints are only observable via tracer fields, but in simulations we can 
predict the configuration and abundance of each morphological component in CDM and FDM. 

On this page we show results for the cosmic web dissection of numerical CDM and FDM simulations into the four morphological components. For more details 
about the internal properties of halos embedded in the densest component (i.e. nodes) in CDM and FDM see [this page](halos.md).
