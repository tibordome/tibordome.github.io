# Axion Dark Matter

Axion dark matter is a hypothetical type of dark matter particle that was proposed in the 1970s as a solution to the strong CP problem in particle 
physics. The strong CP problem refers to the fact that the strong nuclear force appears to conserve the symmetry of charge and parity (CP), which 
could be violated according to the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model).

The axion was proposed as a new particle that would solve this problem by introducing a new symmetry called the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. This symmetry 
would ensure that the strong nuclear force conserves CP symmetry and would also give rise to a new particle, the axion, which would be very light and weakly interacting.

Because the axion is weakly interacting, it would be difficult to detect directly. However, axion dark matter could still have significant effects on the universe, 
such as influencing the large-scale structure of galaxies and contributing to the cosmic microwave background radiation.

There are ongoing efforts to detect axion dark matter indirectly through its effects on astrophysical and cosmological phenomena, such as the search for axion signals 
in experiments like ADMX and the observation of the cosmic microwave background by experiments like Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, so far there has been no direct 
detection of axion dark matter.
