# QCD Axions

The mass of the classic QCD axion is not known with certainty, and it is one of the key properties that experimental efforts are attempting to determine. The mass of the axion is expected to be very light, with a range of possible values from as low as 1 micro-electronvolt (μeV) to as high as several milli-electronvolts (meV).

The exact value of the axion mass depends on the details of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism and the energy scale at which the symmetry is broken. There are also different theoretical models that predict different values of the axion mass.

Experimental searches for the QCD axion are typically designed to target a specific mass range based on theoretical predictions. For example, the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) is focused on searching for axions with a mass in the range of 1 to 10 μeV. Other experiments, such as the Haloscope At Yale Sensitive to Axion Cold Dark Matter (HAYSTAC), the Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion experiment (MADMAX), the CAPP Ultra-Low Temperature Axion Search in Korea (CULTASK), and the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr), are searching for axions with higher masses in the (sub-)meV range.

Despite decades of effort, the mass of the axion remains an open question, and further experimental searches will be necessary to determine its properties.

The axion field after PQ symmetry breaking (post-inflation) acts as a cold dark matter (CDM) condensate, and is thus a promising CDM candidate.

# Ultra-Light Axion Dark Matter

Another cold dark matter candidate are ultra-light axions (ULAs). ULAs are a class of axion particles that have masses in the range of about $10^-26$ to $10^-16$ eV. These axions are often referred to as "fuzzy" dark matter because their very low mass gives them a wavelength that is comparable to the size of small galaxies (kpc scales), which could lead to interesting effects on galactic structure.

One of the main motivations for studying ULAs is their potential impact on the structure of galaxies. Because their wavelength is comparable to the size of small galaxies, ULAs could exhibit wave-like behavior, forming a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that would affect the distribution of matter in galaxies. This could potentially solve some of the outstanding problems in our understanding of galactic structure, such as the "cusp-core" problem and the "too big to fail" problem.

Search for the effects of ULAs on astrophysical phenomena has been an ongoing effort for years. Since the presence of ULAs affects the large-scale structure of galaxies, constraints can be put on the cosmological abundance of ULAs. In addition, the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is sensitive to ULAs and is being searched for by experiments like the Polarization of Background Radiation (POLARBEAR) experiment.
