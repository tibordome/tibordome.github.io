# QCD Axions

The mass of the classic QCD axion is not known with certainty, and it is one of the key properties that experimental efforts are attempting to determine. 
The mass of the axion is expected to be very light, with a range of possible values from as low as 1 micro-electronvolt (μeV) to as high as several milli-electronvolts (meV).

The exact value of the axion mass depends on the details of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism and the energy scale at which the symmetry is broken. 
There are also different theoretical models that predict different values of the axion mass.

Experimental searches for the QCD axion are typically designed to target a specific mass range based on theoretical predictions. 
For example, the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) is focused on searching for axions with a mass in the range of 1 to 10 μeV. 
Other experiments, such as the Haloscope At Yale Sensitive to Axion Cold Dark Matter (HAYSTAC), the Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion experiment (MADMAX), 
the CAPP Ultra-Low Temperature Axion Search in Korea (CULTASK), and the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr), are searching for axions 
with higher masses in the (sub-)meV range.

Despite decades of effort, the mass of the axion remains an open question, and further experimental searches will be necessary to determine its properties.

The axion field after PQ symmetry breaking (post-inflation) acts as a cold dark matter (CDM) condensate, and is thus a promising CDM candidate.

# Ultra-Light Axion Dark Matter

Another cold dark matter candidate are ultra-light axions (ULAs). ULAs are a class of axion particles that have masses in the range of 
about $10^{-26}$ to $10^{-16}$ eV. These axions are often referred to as "fuzzy" dark matter because their very low mass gives them a 
wavelength that is comparable to the size of small galaxies (kpc scales), which could lead to interesting effects on galactic structure.

One of the main motivations for studying ULAs is their potential impact on the structure of galaxies. Because their wavelength is 
comparable to the size of small galaxies, ULAs could exhibit wave-like behavior, forming a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that would 
affect the distribution of matter in galaxies. This could potentially solve some of the outstanding problems in our understanding of 
galactic structure, such as the "cusp-core" problem and the "too big to fail" problem.

Search for the effects of ULAs on astrophysical phenomena has been an ongoing effort for years. Since the presence of ULAs affects 
the large-scale structure of galaxies, constraints can be put on the cosmological abundance of ULAs. In addition, the polarization of 
the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is sensitive to ULAs and is being searched for by experiments like the Polarization of 
Background Radiation (POLARBEAR) experiment.

# Constraints
Experimental observations provide increasingly stringent bounds on the admissible mass ranges of FDM, see [Dome et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03827.pdf). In that work, we provide a non-exhaustive list of recent constraints ordered by publication date, which we also show below:

While the density profiles in the central regions of dwarf spheroidals can be explained with a FDM soliton core potential provided that 
$m_a \le 1.1 \times 10^{-22}$ eV [(Marsh & Pop 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03456), Ly-α observations find a lower 
bound $m_a \ge 3.8 \times 10^{-21}$ eV to have enough power on Mpc-scales 
in the Ly-α forest [(Irsic et al 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04683), constituting a Catch-22 problem. 
Recently, [Safarzadeh & Spergel 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11848) showed that a pure FDM cosmology is inconsistent with dwarf spheroidals across the
entire parameter space by at least 3σ. More sophisticated models of
reionisation are needed though to make some of these observational
constraints more reliable: For instance, most forest analyses assume
that the frequency-averaged amplitude of the ionising background J
in the neutral hydrogen density $n_{\text{HI}} \propto (1+\delta b)^2/(T^{0.7}J)$ has negligible
spatial fluctuations [(Hui et al. 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08297). Some FDM constraints might also be biased due to poor star formation modelling.

# Impact on High-Redshift Large-Scale Structure

The high-$z$ large-scale structure (LSS) refers to the distribution of matter on the largest scales, spanning billions of light years. The *cosmic web* is a 
prominent feature of the large scale structure, consisting of a vast network of interconnected filaments and voids that stretch across the universe.
It is composed of dark matter and gas, which provide the scaffolding for the visible matter, such as stars and galaxies, to cluster and grow. The 
filaments of the cosmic web are the densest regions of matter, where galaxies and clusters of galaxies are found. These filaments are separated by 
vast, low-density voids, which are essentially empty regions of space. Nodes, knots, or virialised halos, form the smallest building block of the LSS. 

At high redshift, the Universe evolves mostly linearly, i.e. linear relativistic (or Newtonian) perturbation theory (PT) still provides an accurate 
description of gravitational collapse in an expanding Universe. When applying linear PT to a Gaussian field, which provides an accurate description of 
primordial density fluctuations in the early Universe, one finds that different wavelength modes do not couple; they evolve independently. Since FDM on 
large scales (including halo scales) is most manifest in an effective small-scale cutoff of the primordial density fluctuations, i.e. affecting 
small-scale modes, FDM imprints at high-$z$ are especially pronounced.

In [Dome et al 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03827.pdf), we quantify FDM imprints on the internal properties of halos by analysing a suite of $N$-body simulations, run for both CDM and multiple FDM models.
