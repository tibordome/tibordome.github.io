Introduction

Hi there, welcome to my Github page! My name is Tibor Dome and I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge. In this page, I will share my research on the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scenario, specifically on the internal properties of high-redshift dark matter halos in FDM-like cosmologies.

Research Summary

In one of our papers titled "On the Cosmic Web Elongation in Fuzzy Dark Matter Cosmologies: Effects on Density Profiles, Shapes and Alignments of Halos", we used cosmological N-body simulations to investigate the effects of an FDM-like power spectrum cutoff on small scales in the primordial density perturbations. We studied halo density profiles, shapes, and alignments in FDM-like cosmologies and provided fits and quantified departures from the vanilla Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model as a function of the particle mass m.

Compared to ΛCDM, we found that the concentrations of FDM-like halos are lower, peaking at an m-dependent halo mass and thus breaking the approximate universality of density profiles in ΛCDM. we also found that the shape parameter profiles are monotonically increasing with ellipsoidal radius in ΛCDM, but the monotonicity is broken in FDM-like cosmologies. Halos are more elongated around the virial radius than their ΛCDM counterparts and less elongated closer to the center.

Furthermore, we discovered that intrinsic alignment correlations become stronger with decreasing m. At z ∼ 4, we found a 6.4σ-significance in the fractional differences between the isotropised linear alignment magnitudes Diso in the m = 10−22 eV model and ΛCDM. Such FDM-like imprints on the internal properties of virialised halos are expected to be strikingly visible in the high-z Universe.
Conclusion

In conclusion, my research provides important insights into the FDM scenario and its potential impact on the internal properties of dark matter halos in the high-redshift Universe. We hope our findings will contribute to further investigations into the nature of dark matter and the evolution of large-scale structure in the Universe.
