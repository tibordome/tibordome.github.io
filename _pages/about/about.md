I specialize in computational astrophysics, which involves running and analyzing large computer simulations to interpret observational datasets. 
My primary research focus lies in structure formation and the gravitational collapse of matter into the structures we observe or infer today, such as 
galaxies and dark matter halos. To constrain axions and axion-like particles, which are promising dark matter candidates, I predict their impact on 
both dark matter and baryonic matter using simulations and (semi-)numerical techniques. In addition, I leverage the power of machine learning models to 
maximize the information we extract from simulations and surveys, such as normalizing flows to characterize neutral hydrogen distributions in the 
post-reionization era.
